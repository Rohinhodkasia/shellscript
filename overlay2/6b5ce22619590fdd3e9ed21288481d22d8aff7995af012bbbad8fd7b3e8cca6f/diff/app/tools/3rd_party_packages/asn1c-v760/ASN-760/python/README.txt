In order to use Python code generated by ASN1C, the Python run-time must be
installed.

The Python run-time can be installed using one of the following commands
(depending on your Python installation):

pip install --find-links https://www.obj-sys.com/PythonRuntime/vnnn --no-deps osyspyrt
or
pip3 install --find-links https://www.obj-sys.com/PythonRuntime/vnnn --no-deps osyspyrt
or
python3 -m pip install --find-links https://www.obj-sys.com/PythonRuntime/vnnn --no-deps osyspyrt

where vnnn is the three-digit ASN1C version (e.g., v740, v741, v742, etc.).

Note that if you have both Python v2.x installed and Python v3.x, it's
important that you use the v3.x pip utility.

If osyspyrt is already installed, you will most likely have to uninstall it
first and then install the new package.  You can uninstall osyspyrt with the
pip uninstall command; e.g., "pip uninstall osyspyrt".

Note that on Windows systems it may be necessary to run pip with a command
window that is started with Run As Administrator.  If you get access denied
error messages when you run pip, then this step is probably necessary.
