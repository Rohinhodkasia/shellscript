ASN1C JAVA RUN-TIME

This README file contains information on ASN1C's runtime component for Java.

DOCUMENTATION

The following documentation is available for helping you use ASN1C with Java:
	 
  ASN1C for Java User's Manual.
    Besides documenting how to work with ASN1C, this also describes the Java
    code that will be generated.
    
    This manual is available online at the following link:
  
    https://obj-sys.com/support/asn1c-manuals.php

  Javadoc documentation. This can be accessed through the 
  index.html file in the java/doc subdirectory.

  XERCES documentation. This version of ASN1C uses the XERCES 
  XML parser for parsing XML documents.  Documentation on XERCES 
  can be found on the web at the following link:
  
  http://xml.apache.org/xerces2-j/api.html


SAMPLE PROGRAMS

A number of sample programs are available in the sample_ber, 
sample_der, sample_per, and sample_xer subdirectories of the 
installation.  


GETTING STARTED

The Employee or MyHTTP sample programs in the sample_ber area are 
recommended for learning how the compiler works.  You will need 
Java SDK 5 or greater on your system to run the samples.  The 
samples can be built using the Apache Ant build tool.  Use 'ant build' to build
the sample, 'ant writer' to run the writer program, and 'ant reader' to run the
reader program.  Most samples have a Writer program to encode  and write a 
sample message to disk, and a Reader program to read and decode the message.


EVALUATION LICENSE

The run-time components of the evaluation version check a license 
key that is generated by ASN1C and compiled into generated code. This is 
set to expire at some future date.

Users who purchase limited, single-host licenses for ASN1C must 
update this run-time component to ensure the license will not expire on 
their designated hosts.  This is done by regenerating the code after the new
license file is installed or by using a binary license file generated using
asn1c -genlic.

Users who purchase an unlimited redistribution license (either binary 
or source code version) just need to be sure they use the version of 
the run-time jar file that comes with the distribution instead of the 
evaluation version.
