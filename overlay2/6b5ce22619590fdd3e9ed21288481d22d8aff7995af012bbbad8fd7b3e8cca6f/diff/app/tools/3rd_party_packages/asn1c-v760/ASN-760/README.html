  <h2><a name="Intro" id="Intro"></a>Introduction</h2>

  <blockquote>
    Thank you for downloading this release of the ASN1C software. ASN1C is an
    ASN.1 compiler (code generator) capable of parsing and generating C, C++,
    C#, Java, Python, or Go source code for the most advanced ASN.1 syntax.

    <p>This package contains the ASN1C compiler executables and run-time
    libraries. Documentation is available online at <a href=
    "https://obj-sys.com/support/asn1c-manuals.php">
     https://obj-sys.com/support/asn1c-manuals.php</a></p>

  <h2><a name="WhatsNew" id="WhatsNew"></a>Release Notes</h2>

  <blockquote>
    This release of ASN1C adds the following new capabilities:

    <dl>
      <dt><b>Partial Decoding of PER/UPER Messages</b></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>It is now possible to configure C/C++ PER or UPER decoders
          to decode only parts of a message and skip over the other
          content.</p>
      </dd>

      <dt><b>Raw Event Parsing of PER/UPER Messages</b></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>A new capability named "raw event parsing" was added as a C/C++
          PER decoding option. This is similar to the existing event parsing
          capabiity except that the data is not decoded prior to invoking
          the event callbacks. This makes it possible to skip over content
          that is not of interest and only target certain fields for full
          decoding.</p>
      </dd>

      <dt><b>Go JSON (JER) Code Generation</b></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>The capability to generate JSON Encoding Rules (JER) encoders
          and decoders was added for the Go language.</p>
      </dd>

      <dt><b>Go Custom Run-time Source Code Generation</b></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>The capability was added to generate a custom run-time source
          file (runtime.go) that only includes the run-time functions
          necessary for a given schema and set of compilation options.
          This reduces the amount of code needed to support a given
          project.</p>
      </dd>
      
      <dt><b>Improvements to ASN1C GUI</b></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Added auto-indent capability to ASN.1 editor. Also added
          support for creating configuration files in ACGUI including
          auto-completion.</p>
      </dd>
      
      <dt><b>Support for 2021 ASN.1 Standards Updates</b></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Support for features in the 2021 version of the ASN.1
          standards has been added. These changes are described in the
          Compatibility section below.</p>
      </dd>
      
      <dt><b>Support for Visual Studio 2022</b></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>C/C++ run-time libraries built with Visual Studio 2020 have
          been added. Libraries built with Visual Studio 2013 are now
          not included in the SDK by default.</p>
      </dd>
      
      <dt><b>Update of Cryptographic Message Syntax ASN.1</b></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Newer versions of Cryptograhic Message Syntax ASN.1
          specifications have been added to the built-in schema set.
          This includes the 2021 updates to the Evidence Record Syntax (ERS)
          and Server-based Certificate Validation Protocol (SCVP) ASN.1
          specifications.
        </p>

  <h2><a name="CodeGenChanges" id="CodeGenChanges"></a>Compatibility</h2>

  <blockquote>
    <p>X.697 JER 2021 adds a new encoder's option for BIT STRINGs and
    OCTET STRINGs that have a contents (CONTAINING) constraint.  ASN1C-generated
    encoders will now follow this alternative encoding, and decoders will
    accept either option.  This made the -jer+ option basically superfluous,
    and it has therefore been removed.  Use -asnstd x680-2015 to force encoding
    without the new encoder's option.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>X.691 PER 2021 specifies that a BIT STRING with contents constraint
    should be padded to a multiple of 8 bits in the aligned PER case.
    To control the behavior of padding for this case, use the -asnstd option.
    The -perpadbitstrings option has been removed.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>UTF8String is no longer mapped to an array for C/C++ when -static is
      used.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Changes were made to Go language generation in which a Go type is now
      always generated for all ASN.1 type assignments. Before, certain
      primitive such as BOOLEAN and INTEGER would be reduced to just using
      the Go native type. In addition, run-time types were added for
      BIT STRING (asn1rt.BitString), OCTET STRING (asn1rt.OctetString), and
      OBJECT IDENTIFIER (asn1rt.ObjectIdentifier). These were primarily added
      to support JSON custom Marshal and Unmarshal or these types to allow
      supporting the JER content format.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Changes were made to Go language generation in which a fixed-sized
      byte array is no longer generated for an OCTET STRING with a fixed
      size constraint. The asn1rt.OctetString type is used instead which
      equates to a variable length byte slice.</p>

  <h2><a name="UnixInstall" id="UnixInstall"></a>UNIX/Linux Installation</h2>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The steps to install ASN1C on a UNIX or Linux system are as
    follows:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Download the ASN1C package that is of interest to you. Packages are
      available online for Linux (x64, x86, and ARM), and Mac OSX 
      operating systems. There are different C/C++ versions of these packages 
      containing run-time libraries built with GNU gcc/g++ or native 
      compilers. There is also a Java package available for each of these 
      operating systems.</li>

      <li>ASN1C for UNIX/Linux is packaged in a zipped .tar.gz file. To
      install, untar the file (tar xzf) in any directory.
      Note that in order to run the sample programs, write access to the
      sample directories is required, so make sure that you have write access
      to the base directory where the compiler is installed.</li>

      <li>After installation is complete, the license for the product must be
      installed. This can come in two forms - as a license file or a license
      key value.  Instructions for installing the license key or file are 
      available the the following URL:

        <p><a href="https://obj-sys.com/support/acguiLicInstall.php">
            https://obj-sys.com/support/acguiLicInstall.php</a></p>

        <p>The compiler should now be operational. The following command can
        be executed:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <tt>&lt;rootdir&gt;/bin/asn1c</tt>
        </blockquote>

        <p>to verify operation.</p>
      </li>

      <li>To use the Python code generation capability, the Python run-time
        package must first be installed.  This can be done by executing the
        following command:<br>
        
        <blockquote>
          <tt>pip install --find-links https://www.obj-sys.com/PythonRuntime --no-deps osyspyrt</tt>
        </blockquote>

      </li>
    </ol>

      <dd>
        <p>The ASN1C run-time static libraries and shared object files. These
        contain the low-level run-time functions for the various encoding
        rules supported by ASN1C. Note that the evaluation and development
        libraries are not fully optimized (they contain diagnostic tracing
        and are not compiled with compiler optimization turned on). The
        deployment libraries are fully optimized.  Also note that 'lib' 
        is a soft link to a directory containing libraries built with a 
        specific compiler version (for example, libgcc4).  To switch
        libraries, all that needs to be done in to change this soft link
        and the equivalent soft link to the platform.mk file to point at 
        a different version.  See the README file within the c or cpp

        <p>The optimized and/or compact version of the ASN1C run-time 
          libraries. These libraries have all diagnostic messages, error 
          stack trace and text, and non-essential status checks removed. 
          The optimized libraries are built with C compiler speed 
          optimizations options set; the compact libraries use space 
          optimization options.  (Note: these libraries are only
          available in the licensed deployment version of the product. If you
          wish to do performance testing, please <a href=
          "http://www.obj-sys.com/contact-us.php">contact us</a> and we will
          make them available to you). As was the case for the non-optimized 
          libraries, the directories are soft links to directories containing 
          libraries built with a specific compiler version (for example,

        programs are broken down into a writer and a reader. The writer
        encodes a sample data record and writes it to a disk file. The reader
        reads the encoded message from the file, decodes it, and then prints
        the results of the decode operation.</p>

    be run using either the GUI or from the command line. To run the GUI, 
    execute the acgui.sh shell script from within the bin directory of 
    the installation.  To run a simple test from the command line, do the 
    following:

    <ol>
      <li>Open a terminal window.</li>
    </ol>

    <ul>
      <li>Change directory (cd) to one of the employee sample directories
      (for example, <tt>c/sample_ber/employee</tt>).</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>Execute the <tt>make</tt> utility program:

        <p><tt>make</tt></p>

        <p>This should cause the compiler to be invoked to compile the
        <tt>employee.asn</tt> sample file. It will then invoke the C or C++
        compiler to compile the generated C file and the test drivers. The
        result should be a <tt>writer</tt> and <tt>reader</tt> program file
        which, when invoked, will encode and decode a sample employee
        record.</p>
      </li>

      <li>Invoke writer from the command line:

        <p><tt>writer</tt></p>

        <p>This will generate an encoded record and write it to a disk file.
        By default, the file generated is <i>message.dat</i> (in the case of
        XER, it is <i>message.xml</i>). The test program has a number of
        command line switches that control the encoding. To view the
        switches, enter <i>writer ?</i> and a usage display will be
        shown.</p>
      </li>

      <li>Invoke reader from the command line:

        <p><tt>reader</tt></p>

        <p>This will read the disk file that was just created by the writer
        program and decode its contents. The resulting decoded data will be
        written to standard output. The test program has a number of command
        line switches that control the encoding. To view the switches, enter
        <i>reader ?</i> and a usage display will be shown.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

      <li>Execute the makefile:

        <p><tt>make</tt></p>

        <p>This will cause the ASN1C compiler to be invoked to compile the
        <tt>employee.asn</tt> sample file. It will then invoke the Java
        compiler (<tt>javac</tt>) to compile all generated java files and the
        reader and writer programs (Note: JDK 6 was used to build all the
        run-time library classes). It will also automatically execute the
        writer and reader programs. These programs will produce a writer.log
        and reader.log file respectively.</p>
      </li>

      <li>View the writer and reader log files. The writer.log file will
      contain a dump of the encoded message contents. The reader.log file
      will contain a printout of the decoded data.</li>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Before Python can be used, the Python run-time must be installed using
      the following command:<br>
      <tt>pip install --find-links https://www.obj-sys.com/PythonRuntime --no-deps osyspyrt</tt>
    <p>
    The compiler can then be run using either the GUI wizard or from the command
    line. To run the GUI wizard, launch the application and follow the steps.
    To run a simple test from the command line, do the following:
    <ol>
      <li>Open a terminal bash shell window and cd to one of the sample 
        directories under the python subdirectory. For example,
        python/sample_ber/employee.</li>

      <li>Execute the <i>make</i> command to run the complete sample
        program. The makefile will invoke the ASN1C compiler to generate
        Python code for the ASN.1 definition and then compile and run the
        writer.py and reader.py scripts.</li>

      <li>Execute <i>python writer.py</i> to encode a binary message and
        write it to a file.</li>

      <li>Execute <i>python reader.py</i> to read the file containing encoded
        binary message and decode it.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Note that the evaluation version of the Python code generation
      capability contains limits on the size of the ASN.1 files that can be
      compiled. It is inteneded to just demonstrate the basic functionality
      of this capability. To remove these limits, either a commercial-use
      license must be purchased, or a special evaluation license agreement
      signed.</p>

    <p>Go sample programs can be run as follows:
    <ol>
      <li>Open a terminal bash shell window and cd to one of the sample 
        directories under the golang subdirectory. For example,
        golang/sample_per/employee.</li>

      <li>Execute the <i>make</i> command to run the complete sample
        program. The makefile will invoke the ASN1C compiler to generate
        Go code for the ASN.1 definition and then compile and run the
        compiled Go executable file with writer and reader arguments.
        The Go executable file has the same name as the sample program.</li>

      <li>Execute the Go executable with argument writer to encode a
        binary message and write it to a file. For the employee sample
        program, the command would be <i>./employee writer</i></li>

      <li>Execute the Go executable with argument reader to read the file
        containing encoded binary message and decode it. For the employee
        sample program, the command would be <i>./employee reader</i></li>
    </ol>
    <p>Note that this must be done from the golang directory within the
      ASN1C hierarchy. A current know issue is that trying to output Go
      code to a directory outside the hierarchy with the -o qualifier does
      not work.</p>
    <p>Also Go compilation in the evaluation version is a limited to ASN.1
      files with 800 lines or less. To have this limit removed, please
      contact us.</p>
