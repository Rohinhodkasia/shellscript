This sample program demonstrates how to use sockets and socket stream for 
encoding and decoding BER messages. The 'client' program connects to
the specified IP address (127.0.0.1:9000 by default) and encodes and sends
data to the destination host. The 'server' program waits for the connection
and receive and decode data on-the-fly.
