  <h2><a name="Intro" id="Intro"></a>Introduction</h2>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The ASN1C NAS/RRC C Development Add-on Component is an add-on that when installed within an existing ASN1C SDK installation, allows C code generation of 3GPP layer 3 components. Specific support for the following 3GPP standards is provided:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>TS 24.007 - Mobile radio interface signalling layer 3; General Aspects</li>
    <li>TS 24.008 - Mobile radio interface Layer 3 specification; Core network protocols; Stage 3</li>
    <li>TS 24.011 - Point-to-Point (PP) Short Message Service (SMS) support on mobile radio interface</li>
    <li>TS 24.301 - Non-Access-Stratum (NAS) protocol for Evolved Packet System (EPS); Stage 3</li>
    <li>TS 24.501 - Non-Access-Stratum (NAS) protocol for 5G System (5GS); Stage 3</li>
    <li>TS 44.018 - Mobile radio interface layer 3 specification; Radio Resource Control (RRC) protocol</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This add-on provides code generation capabilities that allow C code to be generated based on ASN.1 and CSN.1 specifications for the above referenced standard protocols. The ASN.1 contains special markup to support the Layer 3 table-driven descriptions. Custom C code snippets are also injected in places where it was easier to directly support the encoding with C code rather than a formal syntax. Users can modify the existing specifications to generate derivative works or could potentially create and compile new specifications based on this methodology.</p>

<h2><a name="WhatsNew" id="WhatsNew"></a>Release Notes</h2>

  <blockquote>
  This is the initial release of the ASN1C NAS/RRC add-on.</blockquote>

<h2><a name="CodeGenChanges" id="CodeGenChanges"></a>Compatibility</h2>

  <blockquote>
     <p>In version 7.4.1.1.0, various corrections to the input specifications were made.
     These changes will require some changes to user code; they should not be
     difficult to make.  The changes may be summarized as follows:     
     </p>
     <ul>
         <li>TS24501Msg_MobileIdentity will be more like TS24008IE_MobileIdentity (a struct with a nested
         union for each of the alternatives).
         </li>
         <li>Some fields at the end of types meant to capture all remaining bytes in an IE (e.g. "spare2"
         in TS24501Msg_MMCapability) could not handle an arbitrary number of spare octets.
         These fields were generated as a struct with a fixed-size array called "data" and will now be
         generated using type OSDynOctStr.
         </li>
         <li>Some fields will be moved into nested structs. For example, TS24501Msg_MMCapability.v2xcnpc5
         will now be TS24501Msg_MMCapability.octet4.v2xcnpc5 and there will be a new 
         TS24501Msg_MMCapability.m.octet4Present field to indicate absence/presence of the octet4 field.
         </li>
     </ul>

<h2><a name="WindowsInstall" id="WindowsInstall"></a>Windows
  Installation</h2>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The steps to install the ASN1C NAS/RRC Add-on on a Windows system are as follows:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>An ASN1C SDK (either licensed or evaluation version) must first be installed.</li>

      <li>The ASN1C NAS/RRC Add-on for Windows is packaged in a self-extracting executable file
      format. To install, all that is necessary is to double-click the file to launch the installer program.</li>

      <li>The installer wizard will prompt you to enter a directory into which the add-on will be installed. 
      This must be the same base directory in which the SDK was installed in step 1.</li>
      
      <li>The add-on will be installed in the <strong>c/nas_dev</strong> directory within the existing installation. 
      If you wish to do development with a different C/C++ compiler, this can be accomplished by doing a cut-and-paste 
      of this nas_dev subdirectory to move it under a different c_ directory. For example, the default version of Visual 
      Studio for ASN1C v7.4 is VS 2017. If you would like to use the Visual Studio 2019 compiler, cut or copy the nas_dev
      directory from under the c subdirectory and paste it under c_vs2019.</li>
      
      <li>Note also that if you're using the 64-bit Windows SDK, you will need to cut or copy the nas_dev directory from
      under the c subdirectory and paste it under c_64.</li>
      
      <li>The add-on is now ready to use.</li>
    </ol>

<h2><a name="LinuxInstall" id="LinuxInstall"></a>Linux
Installation</h2>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The steps to install the ASN1C NAS/RRC Add-on on a Linux system are as follows:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>An ASN1C SDK (either licensed or evaluation version) must first be installed.</li>

      <li>Copy the distribution .tar.gz file to the root directory of the Linux installation.</li>

	  <li>Untar and unzip the distribution file.  The result should be the creation of the c/nas_dev subdirectory.</li>

      <li>The add-on is now ready to use.</li>
    </ol>

<h2><a name="GettingStarted" id="GettingStarted"></a>Getting
  Started</h2>

<blockquote>
    <p>The procedure to build the library is as follows:</p>
	<ol>
      <li>Open a Windows Command Prompt (Start -&gt; Accessories -&gt;
      Command Prompt) or other command shell window. If using Visual Studio,
      it is best to open a command prompt window for that version under the
      Visual Studio Tools group of the main menu pulldown item.</li>

      <li>Change directory (cd) to <tt>c/nas_dev</tt> (or <tt>c_64/nas_dev</tt>).</li>

      <li>Execute the top-level makefile.

		<p>On Windows, this would be done by running the <tt>nmake</tt> utility program:</p>
        
        <p><tt>nmake</tt></p>

        <p>(note: nmake is a make utility program that comes with the
        Microsoft Visual Studio. It may be necessary to execute the
        batch file <i>vcvars32.bat</i> that comes with Visual Studio in order
        to set up the environment variables to use this utility).</p>
        
        <p>There is also a Visual Studio project file that can be used to build the API
        using the Visual Studio IDE.</p>

		<p>On Linux, run GNU make:</p>
        
        <p><tt>make</tt></p>

        <p>The 3GPP debug and release libraries should now be built.  They 
        can be found in the debug/lib and release/lib directories respectively.</p>
      </li>

      <li>To test the libraries, the test programs in the test_* subdirectories may be 
      used.  Each test directory contains a writer and reader program, and a 
      makefile to build the programs.  To run a test, change directory (cd) to the 
      test subdirectory, execute nmake or make to build the reader and writer programs, 
      and then run "writer -v" followed by "reader -v" to encode and decode the test
      message (note: the "-v" enables verbose output to provide diagnostics on the 
      encode and decode operations.  If not provided, the programs will still work, 
      but will run silently and not provide any output).</li>

    </ol>
