Example of an H.323 user information message.  This sample demonstrates 
the use of a configuration file to select the productions included in the 
generated C files.  In this case, the H235-SECURITY-MESSAGES files only 
contain the items imported from H323-MESSAGES.  The H323-MESSAGES module 
only includes the H323-UserInformation PDU and its dependent types.

More detailed H.323 sample and test programs can be found in the Objective 
Systems H.323 framework.  Contact info@obj-sys.com for information on
