CAP 1.0 is an OASIS standard that describes XML message formats for 
alert information.  The CAP 1.0 standards document [1] describes it 
as follows: 

"The Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) is a simple but general format 
for exchanging all hazard emergency alerts and public warnings over 
all kinds of networks. CAP allows a consistent warning message to be 
disseminated simultaneously over many different warning systems, thus 
increasing warning effectiveness while simplifying the warning task. 
CAP also facilitates the detection of emerging patterns in local 
warnings of various kinds, such as might indicate an undetected 
hazard or hostile act. And CAP provides a template for effective 
warning messages based on best practices identified in academic
research and real-world experience."

This sample program demonstrates ASN1C's ability to create and 
parse CAP alert messages in XML format.
