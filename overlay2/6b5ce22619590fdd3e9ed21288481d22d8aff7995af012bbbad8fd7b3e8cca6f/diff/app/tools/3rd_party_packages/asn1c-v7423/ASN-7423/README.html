  <h2><a name="Intro" id="Intro"></a>Introduction</h2>

  <blockquote>
    Thank you for downloading this release of the ASN1C software. ASN1C is an
    ASN.1 compiler (code generator) capable of parsing and generating C, C++,
    C#, Java, or Python source code for the most advanced ASN.1 syntax.

    <p>This package contains the ASN1C compiler executables and run-time
    libraries. Documentation is available online at <a href=
    "https://obj-sys.com/support/asn1c-manuals.php">
     https://obj-sys.com/support/asn1c-manuals.php</a></p>

  <h2><a name="WhatsNew" id="WhatsNew"></a>Release Notes</h2>

  <blockquote>
    This release of ASN1C adds the following new capabilities:

    <dl>
      <dt><b>Support for Python Code Generation</b></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>The primary new capability added in this release is the
          capability to generate Python code.  Support for the
          BER/DER and JER (JSON) encoding rules is now available
          with more planned to be added later.</p>
      </dd>

      <dt><b>Capability to use ASN1C project (.acproj) Files from Command-Line</b></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Project files created with the ASN1C GUI can now be used as input
          to the command-line compiler by using the -proj command-line option.
          It is also possible to use a file of this type directly without the
          -proj qualifier as long as it have the extension .acproj (the
          compiler will recognize it as a project file).
        </p>
      </dd>
    </dl>
  </blockquote>

  <h2><a name="CodeGenChanges" id="CodeGenChanges"></a>Compatibility</h2>

  <blockquote>
    <p>There have been no known code changes that will cause
      backward compatibility issues with applications that use code
      from the previous release.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <h2><a name="Documentation" id="Documentation"></a>Documentation</h2>

  <blockquote>
    Documentation for this release is available online at the following 
    URL:

  <h2><a name="UnixInstall" id="UnixInstall"></a>UNIX/Linux Installation</h2>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The steps to install ASN1C on a UNIX or Linux system are as
    follows:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Download the ASN1C package that is of interest to you. Packages are
      available online for Linux (x64, x86, and ARM), and Mac OSX 
      operating systems. There are different C/C++ versions of these packages 
      containing run-time libraries built with GNU gcc/g++ or native 
      compilers. There is also a Java package available for each of these 
      operating systems.</li>

      <li>ASN1C for UNIX/Linux is packaged in a gzipped .tar file. To
      install, unzip the file (gunzip) and untar (tar xf) in any directory.
      Note that in order to run the sample programs, write access to the
      sample directories is required, so make sure that you have write access
      to the base directory where the compiler is installed.</li>

      <li>After installation is complete, the license for the product must be
      installed. This can come in two forms - as a license file or a license
      key value.  Instructions for installing the license key or file are 
      available the the following URL:

        <p><a href="https://obj-sys.com/support/acguiLicInstall.php">
            https://obj-sys.com/support/acguiLicInstall.php</a></p>

        <p>The compiler should now be operational. The following command can
        be executed:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <tt>&lt;rootdir&gt;/bin/asn1c</tt>
        </blockquote>

        <p>to verify operation.</p>
      </li>

      <li>To use the Python code generation capability, the Python run-time
        package must first be installed.  This can be done by executing the
        following command:<br>
        
        <blockquote>
          <tt>pip install --find-links https://www.obj-sys.com/PythonRuntime --no-deps osyspyrt</tt>
        </blockquote>

      </li>
    </ol>
  </blockquote>

    The following subdirectories contain the following files (note:
    <tt>&lt;installdir&gt;</tt> refers to the installation directory that was
    specified during the installation process):

    <h3>Base Compiler Package</h3>

    <dl>
      <dt><tt>&lt;installdir&gt;/bin/asn1c</tt></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>The command-line compiler executable file. This is invoked on
        ASN.1 or XSD source files to generate C, C++, C#, Java, or Python
        encode/decode classes and functions. It is recommended you modify
        your PATH environment variable to include
        <tt>&lt;installdir&gt;/bin</tt> to allow the compiler executable to
        be run from anywhere.</p>
      </dd>

      <dt><tt>&lt;installdir&gt;/bin/acgui</tt></dt>
      <dt><tt>&lt;installdir&gt;/bin/acgui.sh</tt></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>The compiler graphic user interface (GUI) editor executable file.
        This GUI guides a user through the process of specifying ASN.1 or XSD
        source files and options. (Note: this binary is currently only
        available on Linux x64 and Mac OSX systems).  The acgui.sh 
        shell script will set enviroment variables required by the 
        GUI so that all required shared object files can be located.</p>
      </dd>

      <dt><tt>&lt;installdir&gt;/bin/asn2xsd</tt></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>ASN.1 to XML Schema (XSD) translation tool.</p>

      &lt;installdir&gt;/bin/ber2indef</tt></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Utility programs for operating on BER-encoded files. The first
        program allows a file to be dumped in a human-readable format. The
        other two utilities convert files from the use of indefinite to
        definite length encoding and vice-versa.</p>
      </dd>

      <dt><tt>&lt;installdir&gt;/bin/dumpasn1</tt></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>A public-domain ASN.1 BER/DER encoded data dump tool. Thanks to
        Peter Gutmann for making this available for public use. The full
        source code for this program can be found in the utils subdirectory
        of the installation.</p>

      <dt><tt>&lt;installdir&gt;/scripts</tt></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>This directory contains Perl script files for doing source code
        editing and other transformations. The <i>rtport.pl</i> script is
        included in this release to port existing C/C++ applications that use
        ASN1C generated code from version 5.8 or lower to be compatible with
        the latest release of the product.</p>
      </dd>

      <dt><tt>&lt;installdir&gt;/specs</tt></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>This directory contains ASN.1 specifications from many standards
        that have been pre-compiled and tested. In some cases, syntax errors
        that may have existed in the original standards were fixed.</p>
      </dd>

      <dt><tt>&lt;installdir&gt;\templates</tt></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>This directory contains template files for applications such as
          client and server code generation.  It is possible for users to 
          alter these files to customize code that is generated or to add
          new template files for use with -gen-from-template command-line
          option.</p>
      </dd>

      <dt><tt>&lt;installdir&gt;/utils</tt></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>This directory contains the source code and build makefile for
        some of the utility programs included in the bin subdirectory.</p>
      </dd>

      <dt><tt>&lt;installdir&gt;/xsd/lib/asn1.xsd</tt></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>This directory contains the common XML schema definitions (XSD)
        library. This contains type mappings for built-in ASN.1 types that do
        not have an equivalent types defined in XSD.</p>
      </dd>

      <dt><tt>&lt;installdir&gt;/xsd/sample</tt></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>This directory contains sample programs related to the conversion
        of ASN.1 to XML Schema. It also contains the XSD.asn ASN.1
        specification which contains the XSD ASN.1 module that is sometimes
        referenced in ASN.1 files that are the result of an XSD-to-ASN.1
        translation.</p>

      <dt><tt>&lt;installdir&gt;/c/lib/*.so</tt></dt>

      <dt><tt>&lt;installdir&gt;/cpp/lib/*.a</tt></dt>

      <dt><tt>&lt;installdir&gt;/cpp/lib/*.so</tt></dt>

      <dd>
        <p>The ASN1C run-time static libraries and shared object files. These
        contain the low-level run-time functions for the various encoding
        rules supported by ASN1C. Note that the evaluation and development
        libraries are not fully optimized (they contain diagnostic tracing
        and are not compiled with compiler optimization turned on). The
        deployment libraries are fully optimized.  Also note that 'lib' 
        is a soft link to a directory containing libraries built with a 
        specific compiler version (for example, libgcc4).  To switch
        libraries, all that needs to be done in to change this soft link
        and the equivalent soft link to the platform.mk file to point at 
        a different version.  See the README file within the c or cpp
        directory for futher details.</p>
      </dd>

      <dt><tt>&lt;installdir&gt;/c/lib_opt/*.a</tt></dt>

      <dt><tt>&lt;installdir&gt;/c/lib_opt/*.so</tt></dt>

      <dt><tt>&lt;installdir&gt;/cpp/lib_opt/*.a</tt></dt>

      <dt><tt>&lt;installdir&gt;/cpp/lib_opt/*.so</tt></dt>

      <dt><tt>&lt;installdir&gt;/c/lib_compact/*.a</tt></dt>

      <dt><tt>&lt;installdir&gt;/c/lib_compact/*.so</tt></dt>

      <dd>
        <p>The optimized and/or compact version of the ASN1C run-time 
          libraries. These libraries have all diagnostic messages, error 
          stack trace and text, and non-essential status checks removed. 
          The optimized libraries are built with C compiler speed 
          optimizations options set; the compact libraries use space 
          optimization options.  (Note: these libraries are only
          available in the licensed deployment version of the product. If you
          wish to do performance testing, please <a href=
          "http://www.obj-sys.com/contact-us.php">contact us</a> and we will
          make them available to you). As was the case for the non-optimized 
          libraries, the directories are soft links to directories containing 
          libraries built with a specific compiler version (for example, 
          lib_optgcc4).</p>
      </dd>

      <dt><tt>&lt;installdir&gt;/c/sample_*</tt></dt>

      <dt><tt>&lt;installdir&gt;/cpp/sample_*</tt></dt>

      <dd>
        <p>The sample directories contain sample programs demonstrating the
        use of the compiler. There are a set of sample programs that
        correspond to each encoding rule set supported by ASN1C. Most sample
        programs are broken down into a writer and a reader. The writer
        encodes a sample data record and writes it to a disk file. The reader
        reads the encoded message from the file, decodes it, and then prints
        the results of the decode operation.</p>
      </dd>

      <dt><tt>&lt;installdir&gt;/rtsrc/*</tt></dt>

      <dt><tt>&lt;installdir&gt;/rtxsrc/*</tt></dt>

      <dd>
        <p>Run-time source directories containing common type and class
        definitions used by all encoding rules. The installation run-time
        source directories contain the header files required to compile the
        compiler generated code. The C or C++ source files will also be
        located here if the run-time source code kit option was selected.</p>
      </dd>

      <dt><tt>&lt;installdir&gt;/rt*ersrc/*</tt></dt>

      <dd>
        <p>Run-time source directories for various ASN.1 encoding rules.
        These contain common code for encoding and decoding using the
        specific rules. Directories are currently present for BER/DER/CER,
        PER (aligned and unaligned), MDER, OER, and XER rules.</p>
      </dd>

      <dt><tt>&lt;installdir&gt;\rtjsonsrc\*</tt></dt>

      <dd>
        <p>JSON specific run-time source directory. These contain common code

      <dt><tt>&lt;installdir&gt;/java/asn1rt.jar</tt></dt>

      <dd>
        <p>ASN.1 Java run-time libraries. These contain the low-level
        encode/decode classes for the various encoding rules supported by
        ASN1C. The <i>asn1rt.jar</i> file contains classes compatible with
        the Java 5 JRE.</p>
      </dd>

      <dt><tt>&lt;installdir&gt;/java/sample_*</tt></dt>

      <dd>
        <p>Sample programs illustrating the use of the Java version of ASN1C.
        As was the case for C/C++, most have a writer and a reader. Some
        contain support code used by other samples (for example, SimpleROSE
        contains the ROSE headers used by CSTA).</p>

      <dt><tt>&lt;installdir&gt;/java/doc/*</tt></dt>

      <dd>
        <p>The ASN.1 Java run-time libraries documentation files. These are

      <dt><tt>&lt;installdir&gt;\java\xerces\*</tt></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>The Apache Xerces Java XML parser implementation. This parser is
          used to support legacy SAX parsing in the generated XER and XML

    The compiler must be run from a command shell prompt. The compiler can 
    be run using either the GUI or from the command line. To run the GUI, 
    execute the acgui.sh shell script from within the bin directory of 
    the installation.  To run a simple test from the command line, do the 
    following:

    <ol>
      <li>Open a terminal window.</li>
    </ol>

    <ul>
      <li>Change directory (cd) to one of the employee sample directories
      (for example, <tt>c/sample_ber/employee</tt>).</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>Execute the <tt>make</tt> utility program:

        <p><tt>make</tt></p>

        <p>This should cause the compiler to be invoked to compile the
        <tt>employee.asn</tt> sample file. It will then invoke the C or C++
        compiler to compile the generated C file and the test drivers. The
        result should be a <tt>writer</tt> and <tt>reader</tt> program file
        which, when invoked, will encode and decode a sample employee
        record.</p>
      </li>

      <li>Invoke writer from the command line:

        <p><tt>writer</tt></p>

        <p>This will generate an encoded record and write it to a disk file.
        By default, the file generated is <i>message.dat</i> (in the case of
        XER, it is <i>message.xml</i>). The test program has a number of
        command line switches that control the encoding. To view the
        switches, enter <i>writer ?</i> and a usage display will be
        shown.</p>
      </li>

      <li>Invoke reader from the command line:

        <p><tt>reader</tt></p>

        <p>This will read the disk file that was just created by the writer
        program and decode its contents. The resulting decoded data will be
        written to standard output. The test program has a number of command
        line switches that control the encoding. To view the switches, enter
        <i>reader ?</i> and a usage display will be shown.</p>
      </li>
